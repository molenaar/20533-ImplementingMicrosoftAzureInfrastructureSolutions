7. Click the  **Beverly Beach** entry.

8. On the  **Beverly beach** page, click **WORK INFO**.

4. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Reset-Azure 
  ```

5. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

6. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want the script to target.

7. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script might remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Azure environment and make it ready for the next module. 
> The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important:** The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it; if this occurs, you will see an error. If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the **Reset-Azure** script, or you can use the Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manually, with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have changed attributes on a user account, and then forced synchronization.
