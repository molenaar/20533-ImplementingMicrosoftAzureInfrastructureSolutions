# Module 2: Implementing and managing Azure networking
# Lab A: Using a deployment template and Azure PowerShell to implement Azure virtual networks
  
### Scenario
  
 A. Datum Corporation's Azure VMs currently reside on an IaaS v1 virtual network in the branch region. To prepare for deployment of IaaS v2 VMs, A. Datum must deploy an IaaS v2 virtual network in the Headquarters region. You determined this is a relatively straightforward process if you use an existing deployment template and modify its parameters during deployment. However, you want to also test deployment of a virtual network by using Azure PowerShell. In addition, you need to prepare your existing IaaS v1 virtual network for establishing connectivity to the IaaS v2 virtual network by creating a virtual network gateway and deploy a test IaaS v2 VM to the virtual network deployed by using the template.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a virtual network by using deployment templates.

- Create a virtual network by using PowerShell.

#### Task 3: Reset the environment
  
1. Close all open applications without saving any files.

2. On the taskbar, right-click  **Windows PowerShell**, and then click  **Run as administrator**. In the User Account Control dialog, click  **Yes**.

3. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Reset-Azure
  ```

4. When prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

5. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want to target with the script.

6. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script might remove Azure services in your subscription. Therefore, we recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment, ready for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, VMs, virtual networks and gateways, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it (you will see an error, if this occurs). If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can re-run  **Reset-Azure** script, or use the full Azure Management Portal to manually delete all the objects in your Azure subscription, with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have verified that VMs can communicate between the virtual networks.



**Question** 
What are the key steps for configuring a point-to-site VPN?

**Question** 
How can you enable communications between VMs that are created with the Azure classic deployment model and VMs that are created with the ARM model?
