>  **Note:** If your account does not display, enter the **Add-AzureAccount** command, and then sign in by using your Microsoft account.
5. In the script pane, in the  _$storageAccountName_ variable declaration at the beginning, replace the _&lt;your_storage_account_name&gt;_ value with the name of the Azure storage account that you created in the previous task.

6. Review the script, noting that it:


  - Declares variables named  _$shareName_ and _$folderName_ for the file share and the folder to create.

  - Uses the  **Get-AzureStorageKey** cmdlet to retrieve the access key for your storage account.

  - Uses the  **New-AzureStorageContext** cmdlet to create a storage context that connects to your storage account by using the access key.

  - Uses the  **New-AzureStorageShare** cmdlet to create a share.

  - Uses the  **New-AzureStorageDirectory** cmdlet to create a folder in the share.

  - Finds the folder where the script is stored, and then declares a variable named  _$sourceFolder_ that references the invoices subfolder.

  - Iterates through the files in the source folder, and then uses the  **Set-AzureStorageFileContent** cmdlet to write each file to the folder in the file share.


1. Save the script, and then on the toolbar, click  **Run Script**.

2. Observe the script as it runs, and then view the output. When you finish, close Windows PowerShell ISE without saving any changes.



#### Task 2: Access a file share from a VM

2. In the AdatumSvr1 blade, click  **Connect**, and then when prompted to open or save the AdatumSvr1.rdp file, click  **Open**.

3. When prompted to connect, click  **Connect**, enter the following credentials, and then click  **OK**:


  - User name:  **AdatumSvr1\Student**

  - Password:  **Pa$$w0rd123**


1. If prompted to connect again, click  **Yes**, and then wait for the remote desktop session to open and initialize. If you are promoted to find PCs, devices, and content on this network, click  **No**.

2. When Server Manager starts, on the  **Local Server** page, click the status for **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**, select  **Off** for Administrators, and then click **OK**.

3. Close Server Manager.

4. In the AdatumSvr1 remote desktop window, switch to the  **Start** page, and then click **Internet Explorer**. If prompted to set up Internet Explorer, select  **Use recommended security, privacy, and compatibility settings**, and then click  **OK**.

5. Browse to  **https://portal.azure.com**, and then sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.

6. On the  **Hub** menu, click **Browse**, and then click  **Storage accounts (classic)**.

7. In the Storage accounts (classic) blade, click the storage account that you created in the previous exercise, and then in the blade for your storage account, click the  **Keys** icon.

8. On the Manage Keys blade, click the  **Copy** icon next to the primary access key. If prompted to allow access to the Clipboard, click **Allow access**.

9. Right-click  **Start**, and then click  **Command Prompt (Admin)**.

10. In the Command Prompt window, enter the following command to map a network drive to the assets file share in your Azure storage account. Replace both instances of  _storage_account_ with the name of your storage account, and then press Enter:

  ```
  net use z: \\storage_account.file.core.windows.net\assets /u:storage_account
  ```

11. When prompted, paste the  _access_key_ from the Clipboard (to paste into a Command Prompt window, click the control box at the top left of the window, point to **Edit**, and then click  **Paste**).

12. At the command prompt, enter the following command to view the contents of the invoices folder in drive Z, which is now mapped to the assets file share that you created in a previous task:

  ```
  dir z:\invoices
  ```

13. Verify that three invoice files are listed.

14. Close the Command Prompt window and Internet Explorer, and then sign out of the remote desktop session to AdatumSvr1.


>  **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have created a file share named "assets" that contains a folder named "invoices." This folder will contain three invoice documents and will be accessible on the AdatumSvr1 virtual machine (VM).

3. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Reset-Azure
  ```

4. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure subscription.

5. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one that you want to target with the script.

6. When prompted for confirmation, press Y and press Enter.

>  **Note:** This script will remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommended that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Azure environment, ready for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Note:** **Important**: The script might not be able to access a storage account to delete it (if this occurs, you will see an error). If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the  **Reset-Azure** script, or you can use the Azure portal and the Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manuallyâ€”with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: At the end of this exercise, you should have created an Azure Backup vault in your subscription, created Azure Backup vault credentials, and installed the Azure Backup agent on the MIA-CL1 lab computer. You should have backed up the contents of the asset-images and invoices folders to the backup vault.
