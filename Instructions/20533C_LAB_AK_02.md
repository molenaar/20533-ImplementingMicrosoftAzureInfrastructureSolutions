# Lab Answer Key:  Module 2: Implementing and managing Azure networking
# Lab A: Using a deployment template and Azure PowerShell to implement Azure virtual networks
  
## Exercise 1: Creating an Azure virtual network by using a deployment template
  
#### Task 1: Access the template on GitHub
  
1. Ensure that you are signed in to MIA-CL1 as  **Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

2. On the desktop, on the taskbar, click the  **Internet Explorer** icon.

3. In the Microsoft Internet Explorer Address bar, type the following address, and then press Enter: http://aka.ms/Mt32e4.

4. Open a GitHub template that you can use to create a virtual network with two subnets. 



#### Task 2: Load the template into new deployment on the Azure portal
  
1. In Internet Explorer, under Virtual Network with two Subnets, click  **Deploy to Azure**.

2. When prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

3. In the Azure portal, in the Custom deployment blade, click the  **Edit Template** link.

4. Review the structure of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. Examine the placeholders for values that can be edited during the deployment. This template contains the following parameters that you can edit:  _location, vnetName_,  _vnetAddressPrefix_, _ subnet1Name_, _ subnet1Prefix, subnet2Name_, _ subnet2Prefix._

5. Review the content under resources to identify type of the resource, its name, and properties.

6. Click  **Discard** to close the Edit Template blade.

>  **Note:** If the template fails to load into the Azure portal, navigate to the following URL:
        [http://aka.ms/Fpqovq](http://aka.ms/Fpqovq)
      . Then, select and copy all the text. Paste the copied text into the Edit Template blade, and then perform steps 4 and 5 to review the template.


#### Task 3: Run the deployment from the Azure portal
  
1. In the Custom deployment blade click  **Edit Parameters**.

2. Type the following information for the Parameters, and then click  **OK**.


  - VNETNAME: **HQ**

  - VNETADDRESSPREFIX:  **10.0.0.0/16**

  - SUBNET1NAME:  **Subnet1**

  - SUBNET1PREFIX:  **10.0.0.0/24**

  - SUBNET2NAME: **Subnet2**

  - SUBNET2PREFIX:  **10.0.1.0/24**


1. In the Custom Deployment blade, under the Resource Group section, from the drop-down list select  **New.** In the New resource group name field type **AdatumLabRG** to create a new Resource group with that name.

2. In the Custom Deployment blade under Resource group location drop-down list select  _&lt;Location1&gt;_.

3. In the Custom Deployment blade, click  **Legal Terms** link. Review the Terms of use, and then click **Purchase**.

4. In the custom deployment blade, click  **Create** to create the new virtual network.

5. Verify that provisioning of the new virtual network with name  **HQ** completed successfully.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created virtual networks for A. Datum HQ.


## Exercise 2: Creating a virtual network by using PowerShell
  
#### Task 1: Create a virtual network by using PowerShell
  
1. From the taskbar, start Windows PowerShell.

2. Sign in to your subscription by typing the following command, and then pressing Enter:

  ```
  Login-AzureRMAccount
  ```

3. To select the subscription in which you are going to create a virtual network, type the following commands, and then press Enter after each (replace ' _Name of your subscription'_ with the actual name of your subscription and make sure to enclose the name of your subscription in single quotes):

  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionName 'Name of your subscription'
  ```

4. To create a new resource group, type the following command, and then press Enter (replace ' _Location'_ with the actual name of the primary Azure region provided by the instructor and make sure to enclose the name of the region in single quotes):

  ```
  New-AzureRMResourceGroup -Name AdatumTestRG -Location 'Location1'
  ```

5. To create a new virtual network named  **AdatumTestVnet** with the address space **10.0.0.0/16** and store a reference to it in the $vnet variable, type the following command, and then press Enter (replace ' _Location'_ with the actual name of the primary Azure region provided by the instructor and make sure to enclose the name of the region in single quotes):

  ```
  $vnet = New-AzureRMVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName AdatumTestRG -Name AdatumTestVnet -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Location 'Location1'
  ```

6. To add a subnet to the new virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter: 

  ```
  Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name FrontEnd -VirtualNetwork $vnet -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
  ```

7. To update the configuration in the virtual network, type the following command, and then press Enter:


```
Set-AzureRMVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet
```


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a test virtual networks for A. Datum by using Azure PowerShell. 


## Exercise 3: Configuring virtual networks
  
#### Task 1: Create an IaaS v1 virtual network gateway
  
1. Switch to Internet Explorer and in the new tab navigate to open the classic Azure portal by typing http://manage.windowsazure.com

4. When prompted to sign in (twice), type in the user name and the password which is either the Service Administrator or a Co-Admin in your Azure subscription.

5. If you have multiple subscription, when prompted, type in the number corresponding to the subscription to which you deployed the virtual network in the first exercise of this lab and press Enter.

>  **Note:** The script takes about 10 minutes to complete.
> The script deploys an IaaS v2 virtual machine named ARMSrv2 onto the first subnet of the IaaS v2 HQ virtual network you provisioned earlier in this lab.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a virtual network gateway on the existing IaaS v1 virtual network and deployed a virtual machine to the newly created IaaS v2 HQ virtual network.

7. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script might remove Azure services in your subscription. Therefore, we recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment, and ready it for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, virtual machines (VMs), virtual networks and gateways, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it (you will see an error, if this occurs). If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can re-run  **Reset-Azure** script, or use the full Azure Management Portal to manually delete all the objects in your Azure subscription, with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have verified that VMs can communicate between the virtual networks.
