>  **Note:** This script may remove Azure services in your subscription. Therefore, we recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take approximately two or three minutes to reset your Azure environment, so that you are ready for the next lab. The script removes all storage, virtual machines, virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important:** The script may not have exclusive access to a storage account so that it can delete it. If this occurs, you will see an error. If you find objects remaining after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the **Reset-Azure** script, or use the Azure portal to delete all objects in your Azure subscription manually, with the exception of the default directory. Do not delete it.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have a web app set up in two Azure regions and Traffic Manager configured to distribute requests between them.
