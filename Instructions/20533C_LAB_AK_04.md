## Exercise 2: Implementing DSC
  
#### Task 1: Install and configure IIS by using DSC and Windows PowerShell
  
1. On MIA-CL1, start File Explorer and browse to the  **D:\Labfiles\Lab04\Starter** folder.

2. In the D:\Labofiles\Lab04 folder, right-click on the  **IISInstall.ps1** file and select **Edit** from the right-click menu. This will open the file in the **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

3. Review the content of the file. Note that this is a DSC configuration that controls the installation of the Windows Server 2012 R2 Web-Server role. 

4. Close the Windows PowerShell ISE window.

5. In the File Explorer, right click on the  **D:\Labfiles\Lab04\Starter\DeployAzureDSC.ps1** file and select **Edit** from the right-click menu. This will open the file in the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window.

6. Review the content of the script. Note the variables that it uses, including the storage account and its key. The script first publishes the DSC configuration defined in the  **Install.ps1** file to the same storage account hosting the VHD files of the two virtual machines (placing it in the default DSC container named **windows-powershell-dsc**), stores the resulting module URL in a variable, and then sets the Azure Agent VM DSC extension on two virtual machines deployed in the previous lab by referencing that URL. The script generates a shared access signature token that provides read only access to the blob representing the DSC configuration archive. 

7. Start the execution of the script. When prompted, sign in with the username and the password of an account that is either a Service Administrator or a Co-Admin of your Azure subscription. Wait until the script completes.

8. On MIA-CL1, open Internet Explorer and navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

9. Within the Azure portal, click  **Virtual Machines** on the Hub menu.

10. In the Virtual machines blade, click the  **ResDevWebVM1** entry.

11. In the  **ResDevWebVM1** blade, click **Connect**.

12. When prompted whether to open or save the  **ResDevWebVM1.rdp** file, click **Open**.

13. If prompted to confirm that you want to connect, click  **Connect**.

14. When prompted to enter credentials to connect, type  **Student** as the user name and **Pa$$w0rd1234** as the password.

15. If prompted again to confirm that you want to connect, click  **Yes**.

16. After you establish a Remote Desktop session to the VM, in the  **Server Manager** window, verify that IIS appears in the left pane, indicating that the Web Server (IIS) server role is installed.

17. Repeat steps 10 through 16 for the other virtual machine ResDevWebVM2.

18. After completing the tasks, switch back to your lab computer MIA-CL1. Leave both Remote Desktop sessions open.
